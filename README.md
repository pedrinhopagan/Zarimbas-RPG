# Zarimbas-RPG
An RPG designed as an exercise to practice the DOM 
It is my first project, I started it 2 weeks after I began to learn how to Code. I found it very fun and easy to come up with ideas since I really enjoy RPG.
It shows how quickly I understood the logic behind the code. (transporting data) And how I was able to implement it for the first time.
